# then, running the calculations in a multithreaded manner on all existing CSV files in the CSVs folder
# using multithreading to manage multiple threads in auditing multiple tables at the same time, and manipulating the same
# output string in a orderely, ticketed manner.

# after the script is completed running, the results are outputted, and the CSVs in the CSVs folder are cleaned up.
